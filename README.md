## How to use:


### note: 
1. The model only focuse on the overheads'(meetings, overlapping works, long discussion and miscommunication etc.) effects on project time and productivities. Benefits in group settings such as better quality work, new ideas and decrease in shared workload should not be ignored when making decisions on team size.
2. A [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kNHM5otdXNKMPb-EecDQZw4IOYc2mlzqqTKs5px_cg/edit?usp=sharing) with adjustable parameters for empirical samples and visualization
